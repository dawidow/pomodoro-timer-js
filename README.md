# pomodoro-timer-js

You can see it live here: [DEMO](https://dawidow.github.io/pomodoro-timer-js/).

Hi! The project you see here is a project I wrote in just a few hours. I wrote it mainly for myself to be able to use it while learning. I believe that the pomodoro technique is one of the best for learning programming and learning in general.

In this project I used **HTML**, **CSS (SCSS)**, **JS (ES6+)**.

Thank you for your attention!
