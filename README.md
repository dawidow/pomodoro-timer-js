# pomodoro-timer-js

You can see it live here: [DEMO](https://dawidow.github.io/pomodoro-timer-js/).

Hey! The project you see here is a project I wrote in a few hours. I wrote it mostly for myself so I could use it for learning. I think the pomodoro technique is one of the best for learning programming and learning in general. The project on desktop devices also plays the sound of the end of time notification.

In this project I used **HTML**, **CSS (SCSS)**, **JS (ES6+, Audio)**.

Thank you for your attention!
